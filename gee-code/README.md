 * 
 * This repository contains the GEE code to detect and monitor landslide-dammed lakes in NZ.

 * 
 * The objective of the study is to automatically map the landslide-dammed lakes caused by the 2016 
 * Kaikōura earthquake in New Zealand and to monitor their evolution at different points in time, 
 * using time series of Sentinel-2 imagery and GEE.
 * 
 * On this repository you will find two files, other than this README:
 * 1. analysis : contains the main code for detecting and monitoring landslide-dammed lakes 
 * 2. app      : (in progress)
 * 3. utils    : contains useful funcitons that are called within the main code file. 
 * 
 * The code should guide you through the analysis, where several lines can be commented/uncommented to 
 * display more content on the map viewer. Feel free to explore, and in case of feedback or bugs, please
 * contact me via e-mail: lorena.abad@plus.ac.at
